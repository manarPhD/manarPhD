We collected data from 448 coffee shops in the area Rabat-Sale-Kenitra. We calculated the distance matrix for those coffees shops and predicted the coffee waste per date [found in files I_n.xlsx] where n in {50,100,150,200,250,300,350,400,448} and then in files I_n_dayj.xlsx where n in {50,100,150,200,250,300,350,400,448} and j in {1,2,3} we state the amount of waste at the end of  each day in each coffee shop waste bin
